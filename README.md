## Tests

There are two types of tests

- End-to-end - using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro). For
  making accurate snapshots (screenshots) to be able to catch regressions
  early. And for testing critical business logic using actual browser as
  end user would.
- Unit tests - using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/). For testing
  validity of the functions.
