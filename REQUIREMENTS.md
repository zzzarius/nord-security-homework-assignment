## Side notes

- You may use the JavaScript framework of your choice
- If you're proficient with TypeScript, we encourage you to showcase your skills 😎

## Home task submission

As for the submission of the task, we fully understand that people have lives outside of work. Therefore, we do not expect home tasks to be submitted within a day or two. On average, we get them back within a week. But if more time is needed – simply inform your recruiter, so everyone is updated.

Once you have finished the task, please let your recruiter know. They will then assign a Nord Security developer to start the review process (which typically takes 1-2 days). After that, the recruiter will share full feedback with you.

We wish you all the best and look forward to meeting you for a technical discussion! Good luck!
